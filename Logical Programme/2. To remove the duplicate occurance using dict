oldList=[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

dictList=dict.fromkeys(oldList)

listList=list(dictList)

print(listList)



Steps:
1. Declare the list with containing of duplicate values
2. Create a dict variable by using oldList, It will create a dict by assuming the keys into dict. It will create a unique value only because, it is not accepting the duplicate value
    By default, It's variable value is None
3. Then, We can covert the dict list into normal list
